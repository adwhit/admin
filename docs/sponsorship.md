# GoSheffield Event Sponsorship

This document contains information for sponsors and potential sponsors of GoSheffield events.

## Benefits

- Up to two slides in our main slide deck. You can either send us your completed slides, or send us some content and we'll create them. Sponsor slides are added to our deck in order of continuous sponsorship length.
- We'll talk about your company for up to 1 min, whilst showing your slides. You use this opportunity to talk about open positions, upcoming events, etc.
- Your company logo on slides. Your logo is present on the first and last slide in our deck (these generally have the longest screen time).
- Your company mentioned on every meetup.com event which you sponsor (again, in continuous sponsorship length order).
- Your company Twitter account mentioned in Tweets from our account before and after the sponsored event.

We recognise that without sponsorship GoSheffield would not be possible, so if, as a sponsor, you have any suggestions for additional benefits, please do let us know.
